# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# 50.times do 
#   p 'in the loop'
#   author1 = Book.new(author: Faker::Name.name)
#   author1.save
# end

# Book.all.each do |book|
#   if book.title.nil?
#     book.title = Faker::Book.title
#   end
#   book.save
#   if book.description.nil?
#     book.description = Faker::RickAndMorty.quote
#   end
#   book.save
